This study estimates the impact of a minimum wage increase on employment when minimum wage coverage is incomplete. Using as a natural experiment a 60 percent increase in the minimum wage in Thailand whereby 40 percent of workers were not covered by the legislation, we found that one percent increase in the minimum wage reduced low-skilled employment in the covered sector by 0.4 percent and increased employment in the uncovered sector by 0.2 percent. The official unemployment rate also decreased because the rise in the minimum wage lowered the probability of covered employment to such a large extent that workers instead turned to the uncovered sector. Although the average wage in the covered sector increased, it is unclear whether the increased labor supply in the uncovered sector suppressed wages because 70 percent of the wages in the uncovered sector were not observed.
