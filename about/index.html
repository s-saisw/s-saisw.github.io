			<h1>About</h1>
			<p> I was born and raised in Thailand but I came to Japan with MEXT scholarship in 2013. Now I'm a phD student in economics at the University of Tokyo. My research interests are in labor and development economics. In my free time, I play video games, watch movies, or do yoga. </p>
